# Connection Fixes and Responsive Design

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Connection Error: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist"

**Root Cause:** Direct communication between popup and content script was failing due to timing and context issues.

**Solution:**
- Updated communication flow to go through background script
- Added proper message forwarding from background to popup
- Improved error handling with timeouts
- Added retry logic for message sending

**Technical Changes:**
- `popup.js`: Updated `fetchContacts()` and `extractConversation()` to use background script
- `background.js`: Added `forwardMessageToPopup()` function to relay messages
- Added comprehensive message listeners in popup for all response types

### 2. Auto Width Resize for Sidebar Mode

**Root Cause:** Fixed width CSS prevented proper resizing in sidebar mode.

**Solution:**
- Made CSS responsive to both popup and sidebar modes
- Added JavaScript detection for display mode
- Implemented dynamic class assignment for optimal layouts

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated CSS with responsive breakpoints
- Added `detectDisplayMode()` function to determine popup vs sidebar
- Applied different styling based on detected mode

## How It Works

### Message Flow
```
Popup → Background Script → Content Script → Background Script → Popup
```

1. **Popup** sends request to background script
2. **Background** forwards to content script on active Fiverr tab
3. **Content Script** processes request and sends updates back
4. **Background** forwards all responses to popup
5. **Popup** receives real-time updates

### Responsive Design
```
Window Width < 500px  = Popup Mode   (480px fixed width)
Window Width > 500px  = Sidebar Mode (100% fluid width)
```
